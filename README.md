# Login-Form-.Net-Development
I designed a login form in C# .Net Framework in which I made two different sites first one is "Luxurious" and the second one is "Games" I assigned specific username and passwords to each site so that one can access them only using correct credentials. This is for beginners for getting knowledge how to start building projects using .Net framework Window Form Apps.
